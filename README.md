Abstract of this work was presented at ISMRM 2021 (Abstract available on RG: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349588965_Fine-tuning_deep_learning_model_parameters_for_improved_super-resolution_of_dynamic_MRI_with_prior-knowledge)

Furher extension of this work, DDoS model, also incorporates the temporal information to improve the reconstruction further, was presented as an abstract at ESMRMB 2021 (Abstract availalble on RG: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354888919_DDoS_Dynamic_Dual-Channel_U-Net_for_Improving_Deep_Learning_Based_Super-Resolution_of_Abdominal_Dynamic_MRI)

This repository is dedicated to the Fine-Tuning project (paper link below), is not regluarly maintained currently. This repo holds the codes used in the original work. 

The final DDoS model and further developments of the DDoS project are on the new GitHub repo: https://github.com/soumickmj/DDoS
